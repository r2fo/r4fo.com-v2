I feel like this is going to be a long post so firstly, I want to thank everyone for their support. Thanks to your contributions, I was able to raise enough funds to rent an additional server.</p><h3 id="throwback" tabindex="-1">Throwback <a class="header-anchor" href="#throwback" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Throwback&quot;">‚Äã</a></h3><p>But before I go any further, let&#39;s take a moment to reflect on the journey. <br> I found most Piped instances to be very unstable. One day they would work fine, the next day they were buffering forever. Luckily I had a domain laying around and a free server from Oracle. And that&#39;s how I started this selfhosting journey, as rafo.tech, back in Oktober 2023.</p><p>In the first weeks, the average bandwidth usage was hovering around 200 gigabytes a day, at most. And that already felt like a lot to me. Within a month, I ran out of bandwidth on the free Oracle server, prompting me to go find another provider (more on that <a href="https://r4fo.com/posts/netcup-server-migration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>).</p><p>Fast forward to today, Piped alone consumes more than 2 terabytes per day, not to mention the Tor relay. These are the bandwidth statistics of the last month:</p><p>(the text continues under these stats)</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes everforest-light everforest-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span> eth0  /  daily</span></span>
