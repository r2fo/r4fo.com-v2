I have switched from GitHub Pages to Cloudflare Pages for hosting this static site (r4fo.com). This is a minor change that will not affect your experience, but for transparency reasons I have created this post. One small benefit is that Cloudflare has more servers around the world, thus the site may load a few milliseconds faster, and I am minimizing the amount of third parties aswell.
