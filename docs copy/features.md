Apl贸s is a rich of amazing features that will help you create a website in minutes. Here are some of the features that Apl贸s has:

## Custom Alerts

Taking advantage of the aready in place "Custom Containers" build by the VitePress team, Apl贸s has customised them to fit the theme of the project. This allows you to create a more visually appealing website.

Apl贸s has various types of information boxes.

- The `info` box provides general information.
- The `tip` box provides helpful tips.
- The `warning` box indicates potential issues or concerns.
- The `danger` box warns about dangerous situations.
- The `details` block provides additional details or explanations.

All of them can be applied using the following formula:

```md
